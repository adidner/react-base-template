## Things I've setup
- React - general framework
- Typescript - 
- SCSS - styling framework
- file hierarchy for components
- Hygen - templating engine -> off the bat for components and probably pages?


## NEED TO SETUP
- ESLINT
- more css general files (specifically a var.scss, with some fonts and colors, margins, nav height, media for max mobile width, min dektop width, max and min tablet width, page nav z index, main nav z index, sub nav z index, notification z index, full screeen modal z index)

### Copy this for a new project and get it all setup with a new experimental part 
### Also lookup various publishing stuff again -> github pages and netlify

## Things to setup Later (as easy to add hygen template stuff?)
- Docker -> do stuff with hygen for injection? Look into how that would or wouldn't work if I wanted to host with github pages
- Similar but for backend? Same repo? different repo? -> also integrate with hygen?
- NextJS - routing
- Redux - state management -> integrate with hygen?
- A few basic components I really like (nav bar and layout and such that I can integarte with the page creation hygen template)
- React Testing Library / Jest -> unit tests -> with examples
- Storybook? -> also integrate with hygen
- CI?
