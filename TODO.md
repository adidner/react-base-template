## Things to Setup First
- React - general framework
- Typescript - 
- SCSS - styling framework
- Atoms, Molecules, Organisms - file hierarchy for components

- Hygen - templating engine -> off the bat for components and probably pages?
- React Testing Library / Jest -> unit tests -> with examples
- NextJS - routing
- Redux - state management -> integrate with hygen?

- A few basic components I really like (nav bar and layout and such that I can integarte with the page creation hygen template)



## Things to setup Later
- Similar but for backend? Same repo? different repo? -> also integrate with hygen?
- CI?
- Storybook? -> also integrate with hygen
